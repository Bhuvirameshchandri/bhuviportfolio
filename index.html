    <p style="justify-content: center;">A photographic studio is often a business owned and represented by one or more photographers, possibly accompanied by assistants and pupils, who create and sell their own and sometimes othersâ€™ photographs.
        <br><br>
        Since the early years of the 20th century the business functions of a photographic studio have increasingly been called a photographic agency leaving the term "photographic studio" to refer almost exclusively to the workspace.<br>
        The first commercial use of photography was in the production of portraits.<br> <br>Photography replaced painting almost completely from the 1840s, with fully equipped studios in existence.
